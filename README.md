# JimmyCoin

An experiment in creating a proof of work blockchain and P2P network in C. More generally, an attempt to develop my C programming, socket programming, networking and cryptography skills.

## Objectives

My basic goals for this project:

- Create a program capable of generating a blockchain structure
  - Create a protocol for a blockchain (block size, transaction format, mining etc)
  - Create a single program that implements that protocol and is capable of creating and mining blocks and adding them to a chain
  - Add the ability for said program to generate multiple wallets and track/validate transactions between those wallets on the chain
- Create a P2P networking aspect
  - Separate program into wallet and node where wallet acts as a client and node acts as a miner and validator
  - Figure out P2P structure (exact requirements to be decided later)
- Convince various crypt 'investors' on Twitter and Reddit that this is totally the next big thing
- Profit
